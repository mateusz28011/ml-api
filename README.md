## General Info

This is my diploma work which I am currently writing. The application allow you to compare different algorithms of unsupervised clustering tasks. 
User can upload his datasets and choose algorithm that he wants to check. Suitable measures and 2D / 3D charts are available for comparison.\
<br/>
I also want to implement Neural Networks, because of it I use Celery with Redis as distributed task queue that will reduce significant load on the main server 
thanks to it, I can provide multiple servers to perform machine learning tasks.

## Technologies

Project is created with:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) with [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
